Credit cards offer the convenience of cashless payments and the ability to build credit history. They work by allowing users to borrow funds up to a predetermined limit for purchases, which must be repaid by the due date to avoid interest charges. 

I'm thrilled to present my recent work on analyzing credit card transaction data using SQL and visualizing the insights with Power BI. This project aimed to uncover spending patterns, detect trends, and provide comprehensive reports on credit card usage.
